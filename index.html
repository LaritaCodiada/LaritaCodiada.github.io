<p style="margin-left:240px"><span style="font-size:14px">Hey, it&#39;s me, Lara.</span><br />
Also known as &quot;LaraCode&quot;,&quot;Laronchis&quot; and many many more.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">For the last year i&#39;ve been working on a little proyect called &quot;The chatrooms&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">First developed in Clickteam Fusion 2.5, it was an app where you could hop in to whatever room you&#39;d like and chat with strangers online, taking the concept<br />
from&nbsp;an area on the internet or other computer network where users can communicate, typically one dedicated to a particular topic.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">I took that concept and turned it into a little thingy, with 3 channels, the red channel, the green channel, and the blue channel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">it was very basic, and included most of the classical things in the app like the server call sound, the success sound, etc...</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">and one of them is the most iconic of them all: the &quot;weaow&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">The popularity among my friends group grew and got it some fame and admiration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">I continued to make updates, eventually adding unlimited rooms, only being identified with name and version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">The last version made in Fusion 2.5 of &quot;The Chatrooms&quot; was called &quot;The Chatrooms 2&quot;, which included things like the &quot;MEGA VIBING ROOM&quot; and name tags.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">&nbsp;it was really looking good until i realized Fusion 2.5 wasnt giving me enough materials to continue with the process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">I stopped the proyect until i could find a new engine to use and remake it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">Eventually, i found Construct 2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">It seemed glorious, i tried EVERYTHING, every plugin, every event, every possibility, and i loved it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">I went ahead and used it for a while so i could get more experience on the engine, and it would just fascinate me more each time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">Eventually, i decided to bring back the old and dusty project i had.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">The Chatrooms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">I added commands, profile pictures, backgrounds, effects, and many many more.</p>

<p style="margin-left:240px">I feel proud.</p>
